  "report": "# OSCE Performance Evaluation\n\n## Overall Assessment\nThe student demonstrated good communication skills and a systematic approach to the history taking. Overall performance score: 7/10\n\n## Clinical Knowledge\nThe student showed adequate understanding of respiratory assessment. They asked relevant questions about onset, duration, and associated symptoms.\n\nStrengths:\n- Asked about onset and duration of symptoms\n- Inquired about associated symptoms (cough, chest pain)\n- Checked for past medical history\n\nAreas for Improvement:\n- Could have explored precipitating factors more thoroughly\n- Missed asking about smoking history initially\n\n## Communication Skills\n- Clear opening statement and introduction\n- Good empathy and active listening\n- Avoided medical jargon\n- Provided summary at the end\n\n## Physical Examination\n- Performed basic inspection and auscultation\n- MISSED: Deep palpation was not performed\n- MISSED: Did not check vital signs thoroughly\n\n## Critical Actions Checklist:\n[DONE] Asked about onset and duration of shortness of breath\n[DONE] Asked about character/quality of shortness of breath\n[DONE] Inquired about associated symptoms\n[NOT DONE] Did not ask about previous imaging or workup\n[PARTIAL] Partially addressed medication history\n[NOT DONE] Did not ask about smoking duration\n[DONE] Performed lung auscultation\n\n## Missed Critical Actions:\n1. Did not ask about hospitalization history - Critical for assessing severity\n2. Incomplete smoking history - Important risk factor assessment\n\n## Summary and Recommendations:\nGood overall performance with solid communication skills. Focus on completing comprehensive history taking, especially social history and risk factors. Practice systematic physical examination to avoid missing key components.\n\nNext Steps: Review respiratory examination techniques and practice eliciting complete social history."
